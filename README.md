# Boba Blast! The Game

This is a repository housing Claire's second, and Berwin's first, boba-centric SoftDes project, **Boba Blast!**.

## Installation and setup
Running the game uses pygame, which can be installed by running `$ pip install pygame`.

While not required to run the game, the test framework uses pytest, which can be installed by running `$ pip install pytest`.

## File Structure
The file structure consists of the following `.py` files:
* `main.py`: Run this to play the game!
* `constants.py`: Static paths are stored here.
* `boba_blast_model`:
* `boba_blast_view`:
* `boba_blast_controller`:

### Static files
The `/images` folder houses files used for graphics. The `/audio` folder houses files used for sounds. Both paths are somewhat hard-coded, meaning that the specific files **must** be in **those** folders. If you're downloading straight from the repo, you shouldn't run into any issues.
