## Welcome! 
In this game, your mission is to collect as many tapioca pearls as you can to make some delicious bubble tea while avoiding the rocks falling from the sky. 

## Project Goal
Our main goal of this project was to create an interactive software that users can interact with. We wanted to create a game that users can play easily and we wanted to focus on the visual game design to create a fun and colorful interface.

## Game Overview
The game opens to a welcome screen, and the user can press any key to begin the game. The game screen starts with the character at the center of the screen with 3 lives. Soon after the game begins, tapioca and rocks start falling from the sky. The player uses the left and right arrow keys to move the character left and right in order to avoid the rocks and to collect the tapioca in the bucket it's carrying. For every 10 tapioca pearls collected, the player makes 1 bubble tea drink. The number of lives are displayed on the upper left corner, the number of tapioca collected is displayed on the top of the screen, and the number of boba drinks are tracked on the upper right corner of the screen. Once the player loses all its lives, the game shows a game over screen and gives the player the option to play again.

### Game Demo

### Character
<img src="website-images/game-components-player.png" width = "20%" height = "30%" style="float:left;margin:0px 30px">
This is the character the user plays as!

The character can be moved left and right by using the left and right arrows, respectively. The character movement wraps around at the edge of the screen, so the game player can easily move from one edge of the screen to the other.

### Game Visualizations
We created all the game visualizations ourselves using Adobe Illustrator. We wanted our game to convey a happy and exciting vibe in the city to replicate the aesthetic many bubble tea stores have so we used several bright colors for our color palette.
#### Backgrounds
Our game contains 3 displays: a welcome screen, the game background, and a game over screen.
